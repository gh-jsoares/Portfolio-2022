# Current personal portfolio web page
For this portfolio I wanted to do something unusual. I decided to present myself
and my projects in a terminal like interface, since I spend a lot of time in it.

I focused on keeping the web page responsive across multiple screen resolutions.

To present a single page experience **React.js** was used.
